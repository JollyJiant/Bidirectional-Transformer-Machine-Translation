# Bidirectional-Transformer-Machine-Translation

My final project for CS 479 Machine Translation at BYU. I chose to build a Transformer by programming each component using PyTorch and connecting them together to create the full architecture of an Encoder-Decoder based Transformer. The goal of this project was to become more familiar with the technical components of Transformers – since most of my experience with them had been abstracted to pre-trained models during my academic career – and build a bi-directional translator that could take English or Armenian input and translate into their Armenian or English, respectively. I built a pipeline to parse and clean TMX (Translation Memory eXchange) files from OPUS [Parallel Data, Tools and Interfaces in OPUS](https://aclanthology.org/L12-1246/) (Tiedemann, LREC 2012) to extract English and Armenian sentence pairs to build a dataset as well.
