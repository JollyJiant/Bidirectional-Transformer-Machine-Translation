<BOS> The atherosclerotic, hypertension-related vascular lesions in the kidney primarily affect the preglomerular arterioles,[1][75][76] resulting in ischemic changes in the glomeruli and postglomerular structures.[4] Glomerular injury may also be a consequence of direct damage to the glomerular capillaries due to glomerular hyperperfusion. Glomerular pathology progresses to glomerulosclerosis,[77][78] and eventually the kidney tubules may also become ischemic and gradually atrophic. The kidney lesion associated with malignant hypertension consists of fibrinoid necrosis of the afferent arterioles,[79][80][81][82][83][84][85] sometimes extending into the glomerulus, and may result in focal necrosis of the glomerular tuft.[81][86][87] <EOS>
